# Introduction

This vignette provides a comprehensive guide to using the `trainingRIntro` package, which is designed to introduce R programming skills specifically for air quality data science. This series of interactive lessons will help you understand the fundamentals of R programming, including data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis, with a focus on environmental data.

## Getting Started

## Lessons Overview

### Lesson 1: Introduction to R

-   **Objective**: Learn the basics of R programming, including installation and basic operations.
-   **Topics Covered**:
    -   Introduction to R and RStudio.
    -   Understanding R syntax and operations.
    -   Basic mathematical operations and variable assignment.

### Lesson 2: Functions and Importing Data

-   **Objective**: Understand how to utilize functions and import data from various sources.
-   **Topics Covered**:
    -   Using built-in functions and additional functions from packages.
    -   Importing data from CSV files, Excel sheets, and web sources.
    -   Basic data inspection and manipulation techniques.

### Lesson 3: Subsetting, Sorting, and Combining Data Frames

-   **Objective**: Master techniques for manipulating datasets to prepare them for analysis.
-   **Topics Covered**:
    -   Techniques for subsetting data to focus on relevant data points.
    -   Sorting data to organize and prepare for analysis.
    -   Combining multiple datasets using `dplyr` and `data.table`.

### Lesson 4: Writing Functions, Conditionals, and Loops

-   **Objective**: Learn to write custom functions and control flow to automate data analysis tasks.
-   **Topics Covered**:
    -   Creating and using custom functions for repetitive tasks.
    -   Employing conditionals (`if`, `else`, `ifelse`) to handle different data scenarios.
    -   Using loops (`for`, `while`) and apply functions (`lapply`, `sapply`) to process data efficiently.

### Lesson 5: Plotting in R

-   **Objective**: Gain proficiency in data visualization to explore and present data insights effectively.
-   **Topics Covered**:
    -   Basics of base plotting in R.
    -   Introduction to `ggplot2` for creating advanced visualizations.
    -   Practical exercises on creating scatter plots, line graphs, histograms, and box plots.

### Lesson 6: Basic Statistics

-   **Objective**: Understand fundamental statistical techniques for data analysis.
-   **Topics Covered**:
    -   Descriptive statistics to summarize data characteristics.
    -   Conducting statistical tests like t-tests and Shapiro-Wilk tests for normality.
    -   Performing correlation analysis to discover relationships between variables.

### Lesson 7: Quality Assurance and Common Pitfalls

-   **Objective**: Learn to ensure data integrity and avoid common mistakes in R programming.
-   **Topics Covered**:
    -   Techniques for quality assurance in data processing.
    -   Handling outliers and data entry errors.
    -   Common pitfalls in R programming and how to avoid them.

### Running the Tutorials

To start the tutorials, load the package and call `start_training()`:

``` r
library(trainingRIntro)
start_training()
```

This function will guide you through the lessons, starting from where you last left off.

## Lessons Overview

Each lesson is designed to build on the knowledge from the previous ones. It is recommended to follow them in sequence:

1.  **Introduction to R**
    -   Basics of R programming, syntax, and operations.
2.  **Functions and Importing Data**
    -   Utilization of built-in and external package functions, importing data, and initial data cleaning.
3.  **Subsetting, Sorting, and Combining Data Frames**
    -   Advanced data manipulation techniques including subsetting, sorting, and merging datasets.

... and so forth up to the seventh lesson.

## Interactive Learning

This package provides an interactive learning experience through `learnr` tutorials. Each lesson includes practical exercises that reinforce the concepts covered.
